SCORING:
During regular time, any word shorter than five letters will count as as many points as the word is long.
Any word longer will count as five points.
During overtime, you will only be rewarded half as many points as you were during regular time.
If your score is a decimal at the end of the game, it will be rounded up. 

DICTIONARY INFORMATION:
This game uses the Collins Scrabble Words (2019) dictionary as its word pool.
Lexicography efforts have been considered, but I do not have text files of the major dictionaries I would like to add.
The game's UI will stay as is.

If you would like to contribute to the dictionary or otherwise, request to do so through discord. My user is Forgettable.#9735
